## Product Vision
"Taste Duel" is a Svelte-based web application that helps users discover their true food preferences through an engaging series of direct comparisons. Using the Elo rating system (commonly used in chess rankings), the app presents users with pairs of food items and asks them to choose which they prefer. After completing all necessary comparisons, users receive a comprehensive ranked list of their food preferences, providing insights into their taste preferences that may not be immediately obvious through self-assessment.

## Core User Experience
1. **Initial Screen**: Users see a welcoming interface with a curated list of diverse food items. Each item shows a name, optional image, and brief description. A prominent "Start Ranking" button invites user interaction.

2. **Comparison Mode**: After clicking start, users are presented with two food items displayed as cards side-by-side. Each card contains the food name, image (if available), and a brief description. Users select their preferred item by clicking/tapping the corresponding card.

3. **Progress Tracking**: A progress indicator shows how many comparisons have been completed and how many remain. This creates a sense of accomplishment and progression.

4. **Results Screen**: After completing all necessary comparisons, users see their personalized food ranking list. Items are displayed in descending order of preference, with their final Elo ratings. The results page includes options to restart the process, modify the food list, or share results.

## Technical Specifications

### Elo Rating System Implementation
- Each food item starts with a default rating of 1200
- After each comparison, ratings are updated using the formula:
  ```
  Rₐ' = Rₐ + K × (Sₐ - Eₐ)
  ```
  Where:
  - Rₐ' is the new rating for item A
  - Rₐ is the current rating for item A
  - K is the k-factor (determines how drastically ratings change)
  - Sₐ is the actual outcome (1 if A is chosen, 0 if B is chosen)
  - Eₐ is the expected outcome based on current ratings: Eₐ = 1 / (1 + 10^((Rᵦ-Rₐ)/400))

### Comparison Selection Algorithm
- Not all possible n(n-1)/2 comparisons will be shown
- Initial comparisons are relatively random to establish baseline ratings
- Subsequent comparisons prioritize items with similar ratings for more accurate differentiation
- Adaptive algorithm reduces total comparisons needed while maintaining ranking accuracy
- Minimum of log₂(n) × n comparisons required for n items

### Data Persistence
- Rankings saved to browser's local storage
- Option to export rankings as JSON or CSV

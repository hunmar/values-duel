# Linting Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Memory Leak in CategoryCreator.svelte
- **Problem**: The component was using `setTimeout` without clearing it when the component is destroyed, potentially causing memory leaks.
- **Fix**: Added a reference to the timer and implemented proper cleanup using Svelte's `onDestroy` lifecycle hook.
- **Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and improves application stability, especially in long-running sessions.

### 2. Console Statements in eloRating.js
- **Problem**: The file contained numerous `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` statements, which are not appropriate for production code.
- **Fix**: Created a centralized logging utility (`logger.js`) and replaced all console statements with structured logging calls.
- **Impact**: Improves code quality, enables better debugging in production, and allows for centralized control of logging levels.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Centralized Logging System
- Created a new `logger.js` utility that provides:
  - Different log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
  - Environment-aware logging (reduced in production)
  - Consistent formatting of log messages
  - Easy toggling of log verbosity

### 2. Code Structure and Error Handling
- Improved error handling in the eloRating.js file
- Added proper validation and fallback mechanisms

## Remaining Issues

Several issues were identified but not fixed in this session:

1. **Type Errors in UI Components**:
   - Various type errors in components like ResultsScreen, Button, Dialog, and Progress
   - These would require more extensive refactoring of the component props and interfaces

2. **Module Import Issues**:
   - Issues with module resolution, particularly with the '$lib/ui' path

3. **Styling Issues**:
   - Global CSS leakage through `:global()` selectors
   - Inconsistent styling approaches

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. **Add ESLint and Stylelint to the Build Process**:
   - Install ESLint and Stylelint as dev dependencies
   - Add lint scripts to package.json
   - Consider adding pre-commit hooks for linting

2. **Improve TypeScript Integration**:
   - Define proper interfaces for all component props
   - Add JSDoc comments for better type inference in JavaScript files

3. **Refactor Large Components**:
   - Break down complex components into smaller, more focused ones
   - Extract reusable logic into separate utility functions

4. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Add error boundaries for critical components
   - Implement a global error tracking system
